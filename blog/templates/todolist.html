<P> You've chosen to moderate comments. The following things need doing:
<pre>
Also need to implement:
   * Possible bug if someone puts a ' in their post. (Which is a PITA)
   * Light touch conversion of plain text to something wiki-ish to save
     having to enter HTML. (And prevent direct HTML entry by users. (no need
     for them to enter HTML directly really)
   * User self-registration system, which includes mailing me when a user
     creates an account. This allows us to decide simply whether to allow
     their posts to be publicly visible easily.

Once that's done, much nicer/prettier templates would be a bonus ;-)

After all that's done we need to refactor things down.
